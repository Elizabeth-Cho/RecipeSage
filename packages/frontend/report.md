I've tried many times to run all of the tests to generate a complete coverage report but it eventually crashed (out of memory) as it reached some of the later test cases. I've attached screenshots of the coverage reports of running the test files for each page separately. 

We aimed for at least 80% statement coverage for the GUI tests given how many pages and statements there are in the application. Below are some notes about some of the failures we saw when conducting our tests. These test cases were generated by looking at the user guide provided and by exploring the site.

- Scaling does not recognize numbers written out as words (ex. 'one' instead of 1)
- Scaling sometimes scales the wrong measurements - The case that caught this was when '1 week old loaf of bread' got scaled to '2 week old loaf of bread' instead of staying the same. 
- Duplicating a recipe doesn't increment the counter next to the copied recipes, as the '(2)' at the end might suggest. It will continue to append '(2)' to recipe titles. 
- Adding a recipe to a shopping list - When 'Select/Deselect All' is checked and one of the individual items is unchecked from the list, 'Select/Deselect All' will not automatically uncheck. 
- Selecting multiple recipes for bulk actions is accessed with a toggle in the options menu. The user has the option to select multiple and deselect all at once. 


Manage labels
- Selecting multiple labels for bulk actions is also accessed with a toggle in the options menu. The user has the option to select multiple and deselect all at once.

- Autofilling with a link - When autofilling with a link and then autofilling the same form again without submitting, if the first link has an image associated with it but the second one doesn't, the image doesn't default to the placeholder thumbnail, but rather keeps the first link's image.
- Scraping information from recipe sites - Sometimes a recipe will have a description associated with the page but it will not be filled in, which was caught by the case that autofills the form with [this](https://www.thespruceeats.com/basic-recipe-for-fresh-fruit-syrup-4108534) recipe. 
- Uploading an image with a url also was not immediately obvious just from looking at the page, as it's accessed by getting options in the top right corner. 
- The error message when invalid text is input for uploading an image with a url is sometimes inconsistent. It either requests a valid URL or states an unexpected error occurred, which makes determining the "correct" error message a little confusing (likely requesting a valid URL)

Shopping lists
- Clearing an entire list - Manually clearing an entire list will remove the items but when running the path through Cypress, the items still exist on the list.

- There's a bit of a discrepancy between the behavior when the paths are followed by manually clicking through and when it's run in Cypress. It seems like when it's run in Cypress, the re-login overlay is able to close as expected. However, when the same path is followed by clicking through, the
